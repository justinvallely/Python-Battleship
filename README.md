# Python-Battleship
A simple command-line version of the game "Battleship."

The battleship is a randomly generated, single point quadrant in a 5x5 grid.

Pick a column number and a row number, each between 1-5 (inclusive).

You get 4 guesses to correctly find the battleship. Guessing a quadrant off the grid will result in the loss of that guess. Your previous guesses will be displayed on the grid for your reference.

At the end of the game, if you haven't found the battleship, it will be revealed.
